growing up with a successful sibling ishard for anyone but that problem isincreased exponentially when thatsibling is none other than real lifetony stark elon musk and yet even inthat extremely precarious situationelon's younger brother kimball has notonly gotten his own share of success butis actually making an impact arguablyjust as important as his brothers withthat established who exactly is kimballmusk and what does he do to answer thatquestion we're going to be taking youfrom the very start of the musk brothersjourneys and bringing you to today so ifyou're interested in finding out moreplease watch the video till the endbecause today we're going to find outwhat goes on in the life of the youngermusk to start with let's discuss thefamily history of the musks familyhistory as many of you may know elon wasborn and raised for the first years ofhis life in south africa and the samegoes for kimball a year younger than hisnow famous brother kimball is theyoungest son of may and errol musk andis the third sibling along with hissister tosca and from the get-go aschildren of a very successful model anddietitian and an engineer kimball andelon were introduced to everything thatwould end up influencing their future bythe time they graduated the brothers hadalready made the move to america startas entrepreneurs and that wascoincidentally also where they got theirstart as entrepreneurs one of the majorprojects that the duo worked on backthen was zip2 a software company meantto catalog city information and in justfour years they managed to earn nearly300 million dollars for the website whenit was acquired by compaq in 1999. asyou can imagine it wasn't as easy as itmay seem as those few years were thehardest work the two had to do with muskhimself recalling during a 2014commencement speech at usc when mybrother and i were starting our firstcompany instead of getting an apartmentwe just rented a small office and weslept on the couch even that wasn't theend of it he added that they showered atthe ymca and we were so hard up we hadjust one computer so the website was upduring the day and i was coding at nightseven days a week and even after thosesuccesses paid off instead of calling ita day the two decided to continue downthe path to success with them going onto invent x.com which elon would laterbuild into paypal which you may remembersold to ebay in 2002 for a whopping 1.5billion dollars later that year kimballwould also make what would turn out tobe one of the most profitable decisionsof his life by investing into a coupleof little startups that went by the nameof tesla and spacex two companies whoseboard he's still a part of today end ofworking with elon however that alsosignaled the end of the brotherly duoworking together because as kimballhimself put it he and his brother have aslightly different take on the world ofbusiness we have similar views thoughhis are stratospheric while mine aremore in the ground as it would turn outthat explanation was a lot more literalthan you might think you see thestarting and ending point of kimballmusk's ventures is ultimately food and abig part of that is farming andagriculture according to the trainedchef as well as an engineer himself i'vealways loved food growing up i cooked inthe house and when i cooked everyonewould sit down and eat and it was justkind of the way i connected with myfamily i used to throw cooking partiesin university everyone would come oversometimes you'd just do a mac and cheesebut if you can do that better thaneveryone else you can get people to cometo you and that's only one of the manyfood related things that he's done overthe years after he split up from hisbrother kimball moved to new york cityand enrolled in the french culinaryinstitute where he would learn many ofthe skills that would come in handy forhis career as a start he along withsculptor and designer jen lewin andfellow food nerd hugo mathesonco-founded the kitchen family ofrestaurants starting in boulder back in2004 and in perfect musk fashion thekitchen is a successful and innovativetake on an existing thing that elevatesit to a different level food business inthe case of this restaurant the name ofthe game is the quality of ingredientsand the principle of using locallysourced items with the company claimingthat they source nearly one milliondollars worth of product from localproviders it is not hard to see howuseful the impact can be on the localsthe entire establishment actuallyconsists of three different bits allworking together first the kitchenupstairs a cocktail lounge with foodprepared in a wood oven and artesiancocktails next the kitchen next door acommunity pub that serves things likeburgers salads sandwiches margaritas andbeer and finally the kitchen itself acommunity bistro that has since itsinception become one of the mostcelebrated restaurants in the entirecountry being declared as such byamateurs and professionals alike thekitchen community since then the ideahas expanded into the kitchen communitya non-profit that works to bring outdoorgardens to schools around the country tospread awareness of sustainable farmingand after just three years of existencethe nonprofit had already built 200 suchgardens in chicago los angeles andcolorado schools reaching more than 120000 children a number which nearlyreached a million last year except forthe pandemic interfering however whatmight turn out to be the most importantof adventures is something called squareroots a venture that seeks to completelychange farming by means of reclaimingold containers and using them ascontainers for controlled indooragriculture it's not bad for you but itdoesn't have that likespinach benefit that you think you'regetting that you've conditioned yourselfbased in brooklyn the company hasdeveloped special modules which arehydroponic farms in shipping containersthat can grow certain non-gmo vegetablesaround the clock and without pesticidesas of today they are successfullyproducing mint basil other herbs andleafy greens right at your doorstep themodules employ software controlled ledlighting and irrigation systems and as aresult aren't dependent on localclimatic conditions as much astraditional agriculture and have alesser impact on the environment thecrops are grown in a vertical systemwithout soil in nutrient-rich waterunder special colored led lights thatare ideal for photosynthesis and thatimpact is also far-reaching since byputting these farms right next to bigcities we can reduce the amount of foodwasted each year in transportation andlarge storage areas which also ties innicely with kimball's brother elon sincethese kinds of modules are the ones thatwill eventually be used when humanitymoves on to mars as kimball himself hassaid regarding the future for me i liketo think in terms of three months outand 50 years out three months out iswhat to do now 50 years out is what ilike to do before i'm dead if i lookback and see specific communities wherei made a difference using food i willpass very peacefully now that's all welland good but that brings us to thebiggest question of all what is thebrother of the world's richest man worthand as you may guess it's nothing toscoff at as a result of his extremelyvaluable 0.04stake in tesla along with the benefitsthat come being a board member as wellas around 2 million dollars worth ofstock in chipotle where he is also adirector and his position on the boardof spacex kimball musk has amassed avery hefty figure in terms of net worthwith the most conservative estimates byforbes placing him around a value ofabout 700 million dollars phew i guessit pays to be a musk now that's enoughfrom the business side let's now shiftour attention to the question everyoneis asking what does his personal lifelook like personal life and surprisinglyenough there's not a lot to go oncompared to other entrepreneurs who liketo flaunt their lavish lives kimball isshockingly reserved when it comes to hisprivate life the same goes for hisrelationships most of which have beenrather quaint and once again veryprivate he once told forbes that he wasmarried to sculptor jen lewin for awhile who you may recognize as the samegen lewin who helped design the learninggardens of big green and while they weretogether the pair had three kids lucastella and august all of whom enjoy aprivate life lewin wouldn't be the onlywork-related relationship that themillionaire would find himself in asafter his divorce kimmel ended up withcristiano wiley an environmentalist verymuch after kimball's heart and as abonus a daughter of a billionaire thefamous sam wiley as an activist shefounded green mountain energy 100renewable energy company that was latersold for 350 million dollars and goes toshow the entrepreneurial as well asenvironmental connections between thetwo and after getting married in july2018 the two seem to share a happy lifegiving back to the world as much as theycan and well that covers the story ofkimmel musk elon's just as influentialalbeit a lot more unlikely revolutionarybrother with which we must end today'svideo i hope you enjoyed watching it andif you did be sure to leave a like andsubscribe for more with that take careand i'll see you guys next time
